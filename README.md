Hello, I am Kasimia Marisa,

I am here to create code to be open source and used all around. This is also going to be the place for me to put out workable code to be used and modified by other users with
no strings attached. 

While this is my main goal, I am also here to produce small scale projects to be shared with others and to get the feedback on to improve on them further. For I need more practice
on programming still. So find any bugs send me a notice.
